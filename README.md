# AUTOMATION
This includes the depth map, depth analysis, grayscale images of traffic video. The video contains an aerial view. I have created 3D boxes around each image and have labelled them with depth, speed and angular positions. The objects/ vehicles are being detected using coco dataset. Yolo v5, MiDAS, cv2 have been used here
